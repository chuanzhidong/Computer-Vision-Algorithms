# Computer Vision Algorithms
A collection of fundamental computer vision algorithms developed from scratch.

## Getting Started

Ensure that the following packages are installed and working on your computer:

    * Python3
    * Numpy
    * Scipy
    * matplotlib

## What's Inside?

As of now, there are 5 key sets of algorithms that I've implemented to help gain a deeper intuition about the underlying fundamentals:

    1. Basic Image Manipulation and Linear Algebra
    2. Convolutions, Cross Correlation, and Filters
    3. Edge Detection
    4. Feature Descriptors, Fitting, and Image Stitching
    5. Seam Carving (Image Modification)
